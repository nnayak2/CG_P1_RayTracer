1. Arbitrarily sized images and interface windows 

read window.txt file for window parameters.
p x y
w x y
where p is pixel width and height, and w is world width and height of screen.


2. arbitrary viewing setups:

read view.txt file for camera parameters.
Format as follows:
e x y z
l x y z
u x y z
n x
f x
where order is eye, look, up, near and far plane.


3. multiple lights at arbitrary locations:

Read lights.txt file for lights. Each light should have following 5 parameters in order given below.
p x y z
a r g b
d r g b
s r g b
The values correspond to position, ambient, diffuse, specular.


4. Multi threading: (If it can be claimed for credit)

If the screen can be divided into 4 integral quarters, the intersection routine runs on 4 threads to render frame faster.


Notes:
a. world width and height and znear determine FOV.
b. look and up have to be orthogonal to each other.
c.if file not found,stick to assignment defaults.
d. file parsing does not have error checking enabled, so it could result in unexpected behavior if files are not correct.
